Please delete from the list below when implemented:

- Company logo file can be uploaded TTW: we have a logo field on the company. The file widget is ready. What we need to do
  there is to add a file handler to save the uploaded image on the filesystem. Should always be a .jpg and filename can be
  logo.jpg


Nice to have:

- Recurring invoices: script to check recurring_term (todo: change it to a date field, analog to due_date) and copy the invoice.
  This script should be started via cronjob then.
- internationalize: date / thousands separator
- Company: invoice_template options in configuration file?
- Company: provide a vocabulary with countries including country codes. This way country codes can be used in addresses.
- batches for lists
- TESTS TESTS TESTS!
