Please delete from the list below when implemented:

- Service description for invoice items should have a text area widget: http://test.ish.io/TextAreaSimple

Nice to have:

- Move "uploads" folder out from templates: comment in INSTALL.txt about write access on this folder. 
- Internationalize: date / thousands separator
- Company: invoice_template options in configuration file?
- Company: provide a vocabulary with countries including country codes. This way country codes can be used in addresses.
- Batches for lists

BUGS:

- Catch the exception if an invoice number entered manually on the invoice form is not unique but already in use.
