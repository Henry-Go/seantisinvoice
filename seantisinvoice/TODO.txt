Please delete from the list below when implemented:

- Recurring invoices: script to check recurring_term (todo: change it to a date field, analog to due_date)
  and copy the invoice.
  This script should be started via cronjob then.

Nice to have:

- Move "uploads" folder out from templates: comment in INSTALL.txt about write access on this folder. 
- Internationalize: date / thousands separator
- Company: invoice_template options in configuration file?
- Company: provide a vocabulary with countries including country codes. This way country codes can be used in addresses.
- Batches for lists
