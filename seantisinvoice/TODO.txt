Nice to have:

- Recurring invoices: script to check recurring_term (todo: change it to a date field, analog to due_date) and copy the invoice.

- Company: invoice_template options in configuration file?
- Company logo file can be uploaded TTW
- Company: provide a vocabulary with countries including country codes. This way country codes can be used in addresses.
